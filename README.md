# etxdb

A blazing fast ⚡️CLI client for ELDB (EdgeTX Lua Debugger).

**Right now this project is in stage of rapid development. Also check out <https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx/pull/3411>**.

Its command set and syntax is heavily inspired by `lldb`, so that people that have previously worked with `lldb` can easily get started with `etxdb` without much learning.

This tool will be also used in all IDE extensions as a backend.
